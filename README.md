 Travel Budy- An Online Partner Sharing Software

Living in hostels, during vacations a large amount of kids were looking for cabs to travel to airports. We created an online software that allows students to make profiles, and 'create' cabs. Other users will be notified of these cabs, and can request to join them. We used Python, HTML and CSS to create this software. We created a detailed document stated the user and design requirements, and spent a good amount of time on laying the groundwork before creating the final software.
